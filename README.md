    <h1>Portuguese Word-Stress Trainer</h1>

    <p>
      The Portuguese language is stress-timed, meaning that words with more than one syllable are not pronounced with the same emphasis or length. If you're learning Portuguese, it's essential to understand word stress patterns to sound natural and communicate effectively. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This simple web application helps you practice stress patterns by giving you random Portuguese words and asking you to stress the correct syllable. It's a great tool for anyone learning Portuguese, whether you're a beginner or an advanced learner.
